# Introduction

This repository is a template for our COVID-19 deployments.  Each new COVID-19 system gets a fork of this repository.

This has two benefits:

1. **New repositories start with a common foundation.**  We don't have to reinvent important but boring things, like the readme, each time.
2. **We can make continued improvements to the common foundation.**  Since they're forks, the child repositories share a common Git history with this template repository.  When we make an improvement in this repository, like updating the readme, that makes it simple to merge the improvement into all the child repositories.
